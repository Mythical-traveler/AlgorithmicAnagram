# Noosphere Sigil Anagram Generator

## Overview

This program is a mystical tool that blends esoteric symbolism with computational randomness. It generates a randomized anagram-like response based on user input, representing a "noosphere response." The program also displays an ASCII sigil, reinforcing its connection to symbolic and occult traditions.

## Features

- **Sigil Display**: A predefined ASCII sigil is displayed at program startup.
- **Noosphere Query**: The user is prompted to enter a question.
- **Anagram Generation**: A randomized response is generated using a character pool of letters.
- **Mystical Aesthetics**: The combination of sigil imagery and randomized output creates an esoteric digital artifact.

## Compilation & Execution

### Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

```sh
gcc -o AlgorithmDiviner AlgorithmDiviner.c
```

### Execution

```sh
./AlgorithmDiviner
```

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Observe the sigil display.
3. Enter a question when prompted.
4. Receive an anagram-like response from the noosphere.

## Interpretation

The generated output is not a traditional anagram but rather a randomized rearrangement of characters, symbolizing the chaotic and liminal nature of the noosphere. The sigil acts as an anchor to the esoteric framework embedded within the code.
